# Motivation

TBD

## NgZone

Another thing to consider is, the `AsyncPipe` relies on zone.js to be present and aware of the value change bound to the async pipe. 
It doesn't really trigger change detection by itself. Instead, it marks the component and its parents as dirty, waiting for the Zone to trigger change detection.
This is especially bad for leaf components, as the async pipe will mark the whole component tree as dirty before being able to update the desired template.
Also in case you want to create a zone-less application, the `AsyncPipe` won't work as desired.

# Setup

The `ForModule` can be imported as following:

Module based setup:
```
import { ForModule } from "@rx-angular/template/let";

@NgModule({
  imports: [ ForModule ],
  // ...
})
export class AnyModule {}
```

Standalone component setup:
```
import { ForModule } from "@rx-angular/template/let";

@NgComponent({
    standalone: true,
    imports: [ ForModule ],
    template: `...`
})
export class AnyComponent {}
```

# Basic Usage

> **âš  Notice:**  
> By default `*rxFor` is optimized for performance out of the box.
> 
> This includes:
> - The default render strategy is [`normal`](https://github.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/blob/main/libs/cdk/render-stractgies/src/docs/README.md).  
>   This ensures non-blocking rendering but can cause other side-effects. See [strategy configuration](https://github.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/blob/main/libs/cdk/render-stractgies/src/docs/README.md#Default-configuration) if you want to change it. 
> - Creates templates lazy and manages multiple template instances

# Advanced Usage

 TBD

# Testing

For testing we suggest to switch the CD strategy to `native`. 
This helps to exclude all side effects from special render strategies.

## RxFor Directive

The `*rxFor` structural directive provides a convenient and performant way for rendering
templates out of a list of items.

Input values can be provided either as `Observable`, `Promise` or static values.

Compared to the `NgForOf`, `RxFor` treats each child template as single renderable unit. Rendering cycles of child templates get prioritized, scheduled and executed by `RenderStrategies`. This technique enables non-blocking rendering of lists and can be referred to as `concurrent mode`.

Each template getting processed as individual task does also mean, rendering can be cancelled and rendered items will be rendered in chunks.

Furthermore, `RxFor` provides access to the rendering cycle and informs about any event happening in form of a `renderCallback`.

However, the rendering behavior is fully configurable and transparent for the developer. Each instance of `RxFor` can be configured to render with different settings.


### Features of `*rxFor`

Included features for `*rxFor`:

- Push based architecture
- Immutable as well as mutable data structures (`trackBy`)
- Provide a comprehensive set of context variables for each view
- Provide a way to fix `ChangeDetection` issues in `Projected Views` scenarios
- Notify about when rendering of child templates is finished (`renderCallback`)
- Reactive as well as imperative values in the template (`ngFor` drop-in replacement)
- `ListManager`: special logic for differ mechanism to avoid over-rendering; abstracts away low level logic
- render every `EmbeddedView` on its own while applying the configured `RxStrategyCredentials#behavior`
- cancel any scheduled work if a remove was triggered for a `trackById`
- cancel any update if a new update was triggered for the same `trackById`

### Simple example using `*rxFor` with `Observable` values

```html
<ul>
  <li *rxFor="let item of observableItems$; trackBy: trackItem">{{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```

### Simple example using `*rxFor` with simple static values

```html
<ul>
  <li *rxFor="let item of items; trackBy: trackItem">{{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```

### Context Variables

The following context variables are available for each template:

- $implicit: `T` the default variable accessed by `let val`
- item$: `Observable<T>` the same value as $implicit, but as `Observable`
- index: `number` current index of the item
- count: `number` count of all items in the list
- first: `boolean` true if the item is the first in the list
- last: `boolean` true if the item is the last in the list
- even: `boolean` true if the item has on even index (index % 2 === 0)
- odd: `boolean` the opposite of even
- index$: `Observable<number>` index as `Observable`
- count$: `Observable<number>` count as `Observable`
- first$: `Observable<boolean>` first as `Observable`
- last$: `Observable<boolean>` last as `Observable`
- even$: `Observable<boolean>` even as `Observable`
- odd$: `Observable<boolean>` odd as `Observable`
- select: `(keys: (keyof T)[], distinctByMap) => Observable<Partial<T>>` returns a selection function which accepts an array of properties to pluck out of every list item. The function returns the selected properties of the current list item as distinct `Observable` key-value-pair. See the example below:

This example showcases the `select` view-context function used for deeply nested lists.

```html
<ul>
 <li *rxFor="let hero of heroes$; trackBy: trackItem; let select = select;">
   <div>
     <strong>{{ hero.name }}</strong></br>
     Defeated enemies:
   </div>
    <span *rxFor="let enemy of select(['defeatedEnemies']); trackBy: trackEnemy;">
      {{ enemy.name }}
    </span>
 </li>
</ul>
```

### Input properties

- trackBy: `(index: number, item: T) => any`
- trackBy: `keyof T`
- strategy: `string`
- strategy: `Observable<string>`
- parent: `boolean`;
- renderCallback: `Subject<T[]>`

### Using the context variables

```html
<ul>
  <li
    *rxFor="
      let item of observableItems$;
      let count = count;
      let index = index;
      let first = first;
      let last = last;
      let even = even;
      let odd = odd;
      trackBy: trackItem;
    "
  >
    <div>{{ count }}</div>
    <div>{{ index }}</div>
    <div>{{ item }}</div>
    <div>{{ first }}</div>
    <div>{{ last }}</div>
    <div>{{ even }}</div>
    <div>{{ odd }}</div>
  </li>
</ul>
```

### Projected Views (`parent`)

Imagine the following situation:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-list-component',
  template: ` <ng-content select="app-list-item"></ng-content> `,
})
export class AppListComponent {
  @ContentChildren(AppListItemComponent)
  appListItems: QueryList<AppListItemComponent>;
}
```

`AppListComponent` has a `contentOutlet` where it expects `AppListItemComponents` to be inserted into. In this case `AppListComponent`s state is dependent on its `ContentChildren`.
This situation leads to the problem that `AppListComponent` needs to get informed about updates of its child views. This is a known issue which has never been solved for `ngFor` (or other structural directives) especially in combination with `CD OnPush` see here: (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/35428) `RxFor` solves this issue for you by providing a simple input parameter `parent: boolean`. If value is set to `true` (default is `true`), `*rxFor` will automatically detect every other `Component` where its `EmbeddedView`s were inserted into. Those components will get change detected as well in order to force update their state accordingly.

The usage of `AppListComponent` looks like this:

```html
<app-list-component>
  <app-list-item
    *rxFor="
      let item of observableItems$;
      parent: true;
    "
  >
    <div>{{ item }}</div>
  </app-list-item>
</app-list-component>
```
