> A set of wrappers for Browser native functions to avoid unnecessary change detection and zone interference in Angular.

`@rx-angular/cdk/zone-less/browse` is designed to help developers improve performance by avoiding the use of zone.js patched API's.
Besides a well documented and typed API it provides a way to use patched API's in a way that is independent of `ngZone runOutsideZone` usage.

## Key features

- ✅ unpatched Browser API's
- ✅ no need for `runOutsideAngular`
