# How to debug zone flags

## Resources

**Example application:**
A demo application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx-angular-cdk-zone-configuration).

As zone-flags mingle with the patching mechanism of zone.js and its usage in Angular it is not always trivial to understand the introduced changes and the impact.

We can debug the zone.js behavior over:

- Browser console
- DevTools performance tab
- Break Points

Let's take some real examples to exercise those options.

The minimal setup looks like this:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-name',
  template: '<div (click)="onClick()">click me</div>',
})
export class AppComponent {
  onClick() {
    setTimeout(() => LOG, 0);
  }
}
```

The zone flag used is the `timers` flag.

In `zone-flags.ts` place the following content:

```typescript
window.__Zone_disable_timers = true;
```

## Browser console

Besides the patching of existing APIs zone.js also add additional properties to the `globalThis` object (`window` in the browser).

The interesting part here is:
The flags we set on the globalThis object
And unpatched APIs `zone.js` maintains over the `globalThis` object

Before (timer APIs are patched):

We can check if the flag is un-set by accessing the window object directly:

```typescript
console.log(window.__Zone_disable_timers); // logs 'undefined' if the flag is active
```

Another, more direct way how we can check if the zone actually patched the respective API or not is to look for the APIs original version which is maintained on the globalThis object if `zone.js` applied the patch.
If it is not present, clearly `zone.js` did not patch the API in question.

```typescript
// logs the unpatched/original setTimeout API if zone was active, or it logs 'undefined' if not active
console.log(window.__zone_symbol__setTimeout);
console.log(window.__zone_symbol__clearTimeout);
```

After (timer APIs are patched):

If you used the zone-flag for timers you should see the opposite of our above logs.

The check if the flag is set should now return true:

```typescript
console.log(window.__Zone_disable_timers); // logs 'false' if the flag is active
```

Now, `globalThis` should have no original/unpatched version present under the zone symbol.

```typescript
// logs the unpatched/original setTimeout API if zone was active, of it logs 'undefined' if not
console.log(window.__zone_symbol__setTimeout);
console.log(window.__zone_symbol__clearTimeout);
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tipps:**
>
> - RxAngular offers more convenient ways to configure and debug zone flags.
>   In `zone-flags.ts` the content looks like the following:

```typescript
import { zoneConfig } from '@rx-angular/cdk';
zoneConfig.global.disable.timers();
```

- Check zone-flags with RxAngular debug helper `window.__rxa_zone_config__log()` in the Browser console.

```typescript
window.__rxa_zone_config__log(); // logs all active flags
```

## DevTools performance tab

As all the executed JavaScript is present in flame charts, we can also debug zone-flags there.

The following images got taken from the performance tab:

![DevTools - Performance Tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/master/libs/cdk/zone-configurations/docs/images/dev-tools_performance-tab_michael-hladky.png)

In the following, we can see how the flame charts for patched and unpatched timer APIs differ.

Before (without any patches):

After (with different patches):

```typescript
__Zone_disable_timer = true;
```

![Performance Profile of unpatched setTimeout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/master/libs/cdk/zone-configurations/docs/images/angular-zone-flags_setTimeout-unpatched-flames_michael-hladky.png)

```typescript
__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['click'];
```

![Performance Profile of patched Event Listener](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/master/libs/cdk/zone-configurations/docs/images/angular-zone-flags_event-listener-patched-flames_michael-hladky.png)

```typescript
__Zone_disable_timer = true;
```

![Performance Profile of unpatched Event Listener](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/master/libs/cdk/zone-configurations/docs/images/angular-zone-flags_event-listener-unpatched-flames_michael-hladky.png)

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tipps:**
> Recordings should be fully identical with flags on/off to make a valid comparison. Fully identical means even the mouse moves and time to wait in between the interactions are important. This will make it easy and fast to find the right spot in flames.
> You can use this tool to compare two charts by drag and dropping the profile measures into the UI. (need to download reports as JSON)
> Every `.js` file has its own different color on the chart (assigned randomly â€“ except native browser calls, they are yellow)
> If you can't find Timings panel, check this thread
> To see who invoked Timer (looooong curve on flame chart), tick this checkbox in extended preferences:
> ![DevTools - Settings - Experiments - Timeline: event initiators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/master/libs/cdk/zone-configurations/docs/images/dev-tools_timeline-event-initiators_michael-hladky.png)
> Search for 'tick' â€“ it indicates that `ApplicationRef#tick` was most probably invoked by `zone.js` (ctrl+F for search over the flame chart)
> ![Performance Tab - search timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/master/libs/cdk/zone-configurations/docs/images/dev-tools_performance_search-method-names_michael-hladky.png)
> Some events may be caused by your browser extensions, to avoid that open the tab in incognito mode

## Timings

`zone.js` patching mechanism is also visible in the flame charts timing lane.
You can find the timing marks before the bootstrap phase of Angular.

![zone.js - Timeing Marks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rx-angular/rx-angular/master/libs/cdk/zone-configurations/docs/images/angular-zonejs_timing-marks_overview_michael-hladky.png)
There every patched API is listed.

## Breakpoints

- Zone Patches listed in flame chart
- Navigate to `zone.js` code to see if patch is invoked
