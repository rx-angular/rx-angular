## Objective

<!-- 
A rough overall explanation of the idea as well as related terms and a quick scatch of the need.
-->

### Approvals

### Expected User/Developer Experience

<!-- 
Describe what will the user be able to do and how will they be able to do it thanks to this new feature. This should be done in a story format, described from the user’s/developer’s perspective, with as many details as possible but without going into the implementation details.
-->

### Background

<!--
Stuff one needs to know to understand this doc: 
motivating examples, previous versions, and problems, links to related projects/design docs, etc. You should mention related work if applicable. This is background; do not write about ideas to solve problems here.

### Prior Art

<!-- 
What has it done before to address this problem?

Show the essential way of solving it at the moment. Do not include specific libraries or solutions/ideas. Those things are referenced in the backgrounds resources section.

Demonstrate the minimal way people solve it at the moment.

### Goals/NoGoals


## Prototype

### Minimal Design

<!--
Include only the essential parts of the code. No error handling, no performance consideration.
This section should help to understand the essential implementation in one small piece of code
-->

### Detailed Design

<!--
Include some important cases. Error handling, and consider how to deal with e.g. performance.
This section should help to understand the tricky implementations in more detail.
Don't take too much attention to typing if it bloats the code too much.
-->

### Caveats

<!--
You may need to describe what you did not do or why simpler approaches don't work. Mention other things to watch out for (if any).
Security Considerations
How you’ll be secure. Considerations should include sanitization, escaping, existing security protocols and web standards, permission, user privacy, etc.
None
-->

### Performance Considerations

<!--
Try to describe under which conditions the suggested solution is performant and which factors play the key role when starting to get bad performance.

Describe a specific situation in which we can run into performance problems
If possible provide a POC or a theoretical explanation of a possible solution.
-->


### Open Questions

<!-- 
List here all open questions, things that need more research or other further investigation. 

The goal is not to answer them but ask the right questions or point out the area of related research.
-->

## Documentation Plan

<!--
Try to describe the important parts of the implementation and how to documented it e.g. importance, a priority by relevance for user, level of detail, example needed.
-->

### Style Guide Impact

<!-- 
Does the documentation influence the way the current style guide is structured? 
Also, does the new documentation introduces any technical implementations of the docs?

If so please name them and give a detailed description of the impact and if possible some POCs.
-->

## Developer Impact

### Public API Surface Impact

<!--
Are you adding new public APIs? If so, what's the change? (method signature changes, new classes/interfaces, new npm packages, config file properties or new config files altogether)

Are the new APIs consistent with the existing APIs? Do they follow naming conventions and use correct terminology?
-->

### Developer Experience Impact

<!--
How will this change impact developer experience?
Are we adding new tools developers need to learn? Are we asking developers to change their workflows in any way?

Are we placing any new constraints on how the developer should write the code to be compatible with this change?
-->

### Breaking Changes

<!-- 
Inclued all breaking changes 
-->

### Rollout Plan

<!-- 
Are the implementation delays about to negatively affect or delay the release of other features or increase the size.
-->

### Rollback Plan

<!--
How do you plan to roll back the change if major issues are found?
-->

### Maintenance Plan

<!-- 
Explain how this library will be maintained going forward in releases after the initial release.
This includes not only releases of the subject of this document but also respects its dependencies.
-->

## Alternatives considered

<!-- 
Include alternate design ideas you tried out, but didn't continue with them.
List their disadvantages or at least why you did not invest more time in researching them.
