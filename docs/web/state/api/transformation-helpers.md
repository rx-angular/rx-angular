## Overview

Transformation helpers provides a set of tools that simplifies the management of data structures in an immutable way.

Currently transformation helpers support the management of objects and arrays.

You can use the transformation helpers without RxState but expect the behavior to be opinionated since in the first place this package is designed to optimize state management with RxState.
