# RxAngular

RxAngular offers a comprehensive toolset for handling fully reactive Angular applications with the main focus on runtime
performance and template rendering.

RxAngular is divided into two initially independent packages:

- [📦@rx-angular/state](https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx-angular/tree/master/libs/state/README.md)
- [💾@rx-angular/template](https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx-angular/tree/master/libs/template/README.md)

Used together, you get a powerful tool for developing high-performance angular applications with or without NgZone.

This repository holds a set of helpers to create **fully reactive** as well as **fully zone-less** applications.
