We are pleased to announce the stable release of RxAngular CDK and RxAngular Template 1.0. With this release, we enter semantic versioning which means no breaking changes in minor or patch version releases. This includes version requirements for our peer dependencies, Angular and RxJS.

Thank you to all contributors and users who have helped us to get here. We are excited to see what the future holds for RxAngular.
