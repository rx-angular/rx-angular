## All-in-One library

ISR provides everything you need to speed up your Angular Universal app.

### Scheduled cache invalidation

@rx-angular/isr provides a simple API to invalidate the cache based on a schedule.
Requests are not cached by default. You have to explicitly mark the routes you want to cache.

### On-demand cache invalidation

Revalidate specific routes on demand, when you need to and not based on a schedule.
This is useful when you need to invalidate the cache when a user performs an action.

### Plugin based cache handlers

Cache handlers are pluggable, allowing the cache to be stored in different locations.
It provides a default cache handler that stores the cache in memory.

### No build changes required!

Easy to setup and use and also no changes to your build process are required.

### Supports Angular Universal

Compatible with Angular Universal is used as a plugin for the Angular Universal platform.

### NgModules & Standalone Compatible
