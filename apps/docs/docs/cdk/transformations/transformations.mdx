> A set of functions to manipulate the state in an efficient way.

`@rx-angular/cdk/transformations` provides a set of tools that simplifies the management of data structures in a performant and immutable way.

## Key features

- ✅ Manage objects and collections with an immutable guarantee
- ✅ Reduce boilerplate to perform state changes
- ✅ Type-safe and tree-shakeable functions
- ✅ Ensure serializable objects and arrays

You can use the transformation helpers without RxState but expect the behavior to be opinionated since in the first place this package is designed to optimize state management with RxState.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @rx-angular/cdk
# or
yarn add @rx-angular/cdk
```
